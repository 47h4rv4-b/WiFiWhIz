### Human Activity Recognition Using WiFiSignal

This project is focused on developing a crowd counting system using WiFi CSI data collected from ESP32 microcontroller. The system utilizes machine learning and deep learning techniques to accurately estimate the number of people in a given area. 
**The aim of this project is to provide an accurate and reliable crowd counting solution that can be used in various industries, such as retail, transportation, and smart manufacturing.**

The project utilizes several machine learning classifiers, including *Decision Tree, Gaussian Naive Bayes, Multi Layer Perceptron, and K-Neighbours*. However, due to the high-dimensional nature of the data, these classifiers did not perform as well as other classifiers. Therefore, the project also includes the use of *Linear Discriminant, Ridge, and Random Forest classifiers*, which were able to achieve better results.

The deep learning model used in the project is a *Generative Adversial Network(GAN)*, which was able to achieve a cross-validation score of 95.21%, demonstrating its superior performance compared to the machine learning classifiers.

**The impact of this project is significant, as it provides an accurate and reliable solution for crowd counting, which can be used in various industries. The system can help improve customer experience in retail stores by providing real-time data on foot traffic, optimize transportation routes by predicting crowd density, and enhance worker safety in manufacturing facilities by monitoring crowd levels.***

Key metrics used to measure the success of the system include accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. The project achieved an accuracy of 93.6% through ensembling the three best machine learning classifiers and a cross-validation score of 95.21% for the deep learning model.

Overall, this project demonstrates the power of machine learning and deep learning techniques in providing accurate and reliable solutions for real-world problems.
